SURE.trendfilter(
  x,
  y,
  weights,
  k = 2L,
  ngammas = 250L,
  gammas = NULL,
  nx.eval = 1500L,

\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector of observed values of the input variable (a.k.a. the 
predictor, covariate, explanatory variable, regressor, independent variable, 
control variable, etc.)}

\item{y}{The vector of observed values of the output variable (a.k.a. the
response, target, outcome, regressand, dependent variable, etc.).}

\item{weights}{\strong{Currently mandatory. If the uncertainty in the 
observed outputs is not well understood, use \code{cv.trendfilter} instead.} 
\cr \cr 
A vector of weights for the observed outputs. These are defined as 
\code{weights = 1 / sigma^2}, where \code{sigma} is a vector of standard 
errors of the uncertainty in the observed outputs. \code{weights} should 
either have length equal to 1 (corresponding to observations with a constant 
(scalar) variance of \code{sigma = 1/sqrt(weights)}) or length equal to 
\code{length(y)} (i.e. general heteroskedastic noise).}

\item{k}{The degree of the trend filtering estimator. Defaults to 
\code{k = 2} (quadratic trend filtering). Must be one of \code{k = 0,1,2,3},
although \code{k = 3} is discouraged due to algorithmic instability (and is
visually indistinguishable from \code{k = 2} anyway).}

\item{ngammas}{Integer. The number of trend filtering hyperparameter values 
to run the grid search over.}

\item{gammas}{Overrides \code{ngammas} if passed. A user-supplied vector of 
trend filtering hyperparameter values to run the grid search over. It is
advisable to let the vector be equally-spaced in log-space and provided in 
descending order. The function output will contain the sorted hyperparameter
vector regardless of the input ordering, and all related output objects 
(e.g. the \code{errors} vector) will correspond to the sorted ordering. 
Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to leave this \code{NULL}.}

\item{nx.eval}{Integer. The length of the equally-spaced \code{x} grid to 
evaluate the optimized trend filtering estimate on.}

\item{x.eval}{Overrides \code{nx.eval} if passed. A user-supplied grid of 
inputs to evaluate the optimized trend filtering estimate on.}

\item{thinning}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the data are preprocessed so 
that a smaller, better conditioned data set is used for fitting. When left
\code{NULL}, the default, the optimization will automatically detect whether 
thinning should be applied (i.e., cases in which the numerical fitting 
algorithm will struggle to converge). This preprocessing procedure is 
controlled by the \code{x_tol} argument of 
\code{\link[glmgen]{trendfilter.control.list}}.}

\item{optimization.params}{a named list of parameters produced by the
\pkg{glmgen} function \code{\link[glmgen]{trendfilter.control.list}} that
contains all parameter choices (user-supplied or defaults) to be passed to 
the trend filtering ADMM algorithm
(\href{http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/fasttf.pdf}{Ramdas and
Tibshirani 2016}). See the linked function documentation for full details. 
No technical understanding of the ADMM algorithm is needed and the default
parameter choices will almost always suffice. However, the following three 
parameters may require some adjustments to ensure that your trend filtering
estimate has sufficiently converged:
\enumerate{ 
\item{\code{max_iter}}: Maximum iterations allowed for the trend filtering 
convex optimization. Defaults to \code{max_iter = 600L}. Increase this if 
the trend filtering estimate does not appear to have fully converged to a 
reasonable estimate of the signal.
\item{\code{obj_tol}}: The tolerance used in the convex optimization stopping 
criterion; when the relative change in the objective function is less than 
this value, the algorithm terminates. Decrease this if the trend filtering 
estimate does not appear to have fully converged to a reasonable estimate of 
the signal.
\item{x_tol}: defines uniqueness or sameness of \code{x}'s. If we make bins 
of size \code{x_tol} and find at least two \code{x}'s which fall into the 
same bin, then we thin the data.
}}
}
\value{
An object of class 'SURE.trendfilter'. This is a list with the 
following elements:
\item{x.eval}{The grid of inputs the optimized trend filtering estimate was 
evaluated on.}
\item{tf.estimate}{The optimized trend filtering estimate of the signal, 
evaluated on \code{x.eval}.}
\item{validation.method}{"SURE"}
\item{gammas}{Vector of hyperparameter values tested during validation
(always returned in descending order).}
\item{errors}{Vector of SURE error estimates corresponding to the 
*descending* set of gamma values tested during validation.}
\item{gamma.min}{Hyperparameter value that minimizes the SURE error curve.}
\item{edfs}{Vector of effective degrees of freedom for all trend filtering
estimators fit during validation.}
\item{edf.min}{The effective degrees of freedom of the optimally-tuned trend 
filtering estimator.}
\item{i.min}{The index of \code{gammas} (descending order) that minimizes 
the SURE error curve.}
\item{x}{The vector of the observed inputs.}
\item{y}{The vector of the observed outputs.}
\item{weights}{A vector of weights for the observed outputs. These are
defined as \code{weights = 1 / sigma^2}, where \code{sigma} is a vector of 
standard errors of the uncertainty in the observed outputs.}
\item{fitted.values}{The optimized trend filtering estimate of the signal, 
evaluated at the observed inputs \code{x}.}
\item{residuals}{\code{residuals = y - fitted.values}.}
\item{k}{The degree of the trend filtering estimator.}
\item{thinning}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the data are preprocessed so 
that a smaller, better conditioned data set is used for fitting.}
\item{optimization.params}{a list of parameters that control the trend
filtering convex optimization.}
\item{n.iter}{Vector of the number of iterations needed for the ADMM
algorithm to converge within the given tolerance, for each hyperparameter
value. If many of these are exactly equal to \code{max_iter}, then their
solutions have not converged with the tolerance specified by \code{obj_tol}.
In which case, it is often prudent to increase \code{max_iter}.}
\item{x.scale, y.scale, data.scaled}{for internal use.}

\description{
\loadmathjax{} \code{SURE.trendfilter} estimates the fixed-input 
mean-squared error of a trend filtering estimator (via Stein's unbiased risk 
estimate) on a grid of values for the hyperparameter \code{gamma}, and 
returns the full error curve and the optimized trend filtering estimate 
within a larger list with useful ancillary information.

#############################################################################
# A quasar is an extremely luminous galaxy with an active supermassive black 
# hole at its center. Absorptions in the spectra of quasars at vast 
# cosmological distances from our galaxy reveal the presence of a gaseous 
# medium permeating the entirety of intergalactic space -- appropriately 
# named the 'intergalactic medium'. These absorptions allow astronomers to 
# study the structure of the Universe using the distribution of these 
# absorptions in quasar spectra. Particularly important is the 'forest' of 
# absorptions that arise from the Lyman-alpha spectral line, which traces 
# the presence of electrically neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.
#
# Here, we are interested in denoising the Lyman-alpha forest of a quasar 
# spectroscopically measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. SDSS spectra 
# are equally spaced in log10 wavelength space, aside from some instances of 
# masked pixels.
